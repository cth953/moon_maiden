        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            I started on this spiritual journey at a low point in my life. I wasn’t sure what exactly I was looking for, but I was sure I hadn’t found it yet. As a person who has experienced anxiety and depression nearly all my life, I was well aware of the usual ‘fixes’. Finding what was right for me has been and continues to be a battle. Some days I still get low. Allowing myself to acknowledge that has been a big step for me in getting well. Along with my connection to spirit, my ancestors, and my guides, I have carved out a path to wellness for myself. I guess you could call it my own brand of religion. I believe in the power of the universe and the power of self. I believe we all have a little magic within us and if we can tap into it we can change our worlds. The collective is being asked to go within and gain knowledge, to connect and share that knowledge. I hope to do that for you while you’re here today. These are my experiences and what has worked for me. I encourage you to take what you need and add what you need to make spirituality your own. Blessed be.

        <h4>Gemini Moon Ritual Bath</h4>
        <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Moon Water
            <li>Epsom or Himalayan Salt</li>
            <li>Lavender Essential Oil</li>
             <li>Blue Flower Petals Of Choice</li>
            <li>Fresh Mint</li>
            <li>Lemon Slices</li>
            <li>Coconut Milk</li>
            <li>Crystals (Clear Quartz, Blue Moonstone, Lapis Lazuli</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h5>Directions:</h5>
        <p>In a saucepot, combine 4 cups of water, 1 cup of salt, mint, and lemon slices. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes.
            Cleanse your space with white sage, Palo Santo, or incense smoke. Fill a bath with water at your prefered temperature. Add your potion, moon water, coconut milk, essential oil and flower petals. Add your crystals.
            Pray with intention over the water. Gemini is a great communicator, and the full moon energy is about realse. What communication blocks do you need to let go of?
            What can you release? How can you communicate more effectivly? Think of these things as you step into the bath.
            When you are finished, drain the bath visualizing what you are letting go of as the water leaves the tub. Give thanks to the universe.  </p>
